## 0.6.0

## 0.5.0

- Released together with the `workspace` fixed group.

## 0.4.1

- Released together with the `workspace` fixed group.

## 0.4.0

- **Git-access layer decoupling, performance, and small correctness fixes**
  
  - **Breaking (library consumers only):** `callisto-conventional`'s public functions no longer take a `callisto-vcs` type directly.
  - A `BREAKING CHANGE:` commit footer is now parsed correctly.
  - Commits merged in from another branch are no longer missed when scanning history since the last tag.
  - `^1.2.3` no longer incorrectly matches a prerelease like `1.9.0-alpha.1`.
  - Compound Cargo dependency ranges are now rewritten correctly during a version bump.
  - PEP 440 prerelease detection and version-range matching for Python packages is now correct.
  - Python dependency names are now matched with PEP 503 normalization (e.g. `My-Package` and `my_package` are treated as the same dependency).
  - npm publish now auto-detects your workspace's package manager (pnpm/yarn/bun/npm) instead of assuming npm.
  - A few errors that used to share one error code now have their own, more specific code.
  - `status`, `plan-snapshot`, `plan-publish`, and `plan-version` are now faster on large repos — the git repository is no longer rediscovered per package.
  - Tag-existence checks now use a cached index instead of one lookup per release.
- **Manifest writes are batched and more reliable**
  
  - **Breaking (custom manifest integrations only):** implementing callisto's `Manifest` trait now requires a `persist()` method to actually write your changes.
  - Re-running a version bump is now safe and won't risk losing a write.
  - Multiple changes to the same manifest file in one run are now applied together instead of risking one overwriting another.
- **npm publish access modeled as a 3-state enum**
  
  - **Breaking:** `plan-publish`'s npm target now reports `access` (`"public"`/`"restricted"`/unset) instead of a `restricted: bool` — update anything parsing that JSON field.
  - An unscoped npm package with `publishConfig.access: "public"` in its `package.json` is no longer silently dropped during publish planning.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- # Security hardening, correctness fixes, and performance improvements
  
  ## Security
  
  - **Argument injection in publish client** (`callisto-graph`): Package names are now validated before being passed to `cargo publish`, `npm publish`, and `pypi publish`. Names beginning with `-` are rejected with an error, preventing a crafted package name from injecting flags into the subprocess.
  - **Path traversal in `changesets.dir` config** (`callisto-graph`): The `changesets.dir` value from `callisto.toml` is now validated to contain no `..` components. A value like `../../tmp` previously allowed all changeset read and write operations to escape the workspace root.
  
  ## Correctness
  
  - **Changelog idempotency on stable release after pre-release** (`callisto-changelog`): The duplicate-entry guard in `prepend()` used a substring check that incorrectly matched `## 1.0.0-alpha.1` when writing `## 1.0.0`, permanently suppressing the stable release section. Now uses an exact line-boundary match.
  - **Empty changelog section headings** (`callisto-changelog`): `### Patch Changes` (and equivalent headings) are no longer emitted when every entry in the section has a blank summary.
  - **`pre-major-inference` config field now applied** (`callisto-graph`): The per-package `pre-major-inference` setting in `callisto.toml` was parsed and stored but never consulted. `aggregate()` hardcoded `OFF` for every package. The configured policy is now applied when constructing the inference window.
  - **Inference errors now surfaced as diagnostics** (`callisto-graph`): When `SeverityInference::infer` returns an error (e.g. due to a git failure), the error was previously swallowed with no diagnostic emitted and no bump recorded. The affected package now receives a warning-level diagnostic describing the failure.
  - **Ambiguous bare package name now errors in `status`** (`callisto-graph`): In a polyglot workspace containing both `cargo/foo` and `npm/foo`, a changeset entry naming bare `foo` was silently applied to every matching package. `status()` now returns `GraphError::AmbiguousName` with the full candidate list.
  - **Version overflow returns error instead of wrapping** (`callisto-format`): Incrementing a version component equal to `u64::MAX` previously wrapped to `0` in release builds (producing a version lower than the input) and panicked in debug builds. All bump paths now use `checked_add(1)` and return `BumpError::Overflow`.
  - **Decor preserved on full-table dependency form** (`callisto-manifests`): `CargoToml::update_dependency_spec` did not clone and reapply surrounding decor when the dependency used the `[dependencies.name]` full-table form, causing trailing comments and formatting to be lost on the first version bump.
  
  ## Performance
  
  - **O(N²) package lookups eliminated in publish and version commands** (`callisto-graph`): `plan_publish` and `plan_version` called `packages().find()` inside loops over package IDs and severity entries, giving O(N²) complexity. A single `HashMap<&PackageId, &Package>` is now built once before each loop.
  - **O(N) toposort validation** (`callisto-graph`): The toposort subset-validation loop called `all_packages.contains(id)` (O(N) slice scan) per member. A `HashSet` built once before the loop reduces this to O(N) total.
  - **Eliminated intermediate allocations in graph resolver** (`callisto-graph`): `dependencies_of()` and `dependents_of()` allocated a `Vec<&DepEdge>` and immediately called `into_iter()`. Both now return the iterator directly via `flat_map`.
  - **Unique changeset slugs without clock dependency** (`callisto-cli`): `generate_human_slug` derived all three word indices from a single nanosecond timestamp, yielding at most 8,000 distinct values. Concurrent `callisto add` calls on systems with coarse clock resolution could produce the same slug, causing `atomic_write` to silently overwrite the earlier changeset. Slugs now incorporate a process-global atomic counter for guaranteed uniqueness.
  
  ## Housekeeping
  
  - Removed unreachable `calculate_bump_severity` function from `cascade.rs` that was suppressed with `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
