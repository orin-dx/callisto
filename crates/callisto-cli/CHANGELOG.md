# callisto-cli

## 0.6.0

- **Add `callisto filter-plan` and the primitives it's built on**
  
  New `callisto filter-plan --plan <plan> --report <report>` filters a publish plan down to what a publish report confirms actually succeeded, dropping anything that failed. Lets a release pipeline run `plan-publish` -> `publish` -> `tag`/`gh release create` as separate steps and have the last two operate on what actually shipped, instead of the pre-publish plan.
  
  Built on two new, additive primitives: `PublishPlan::is_empty()`, and `CreatedTag.isFloatingMajor` (distinguishes a floating major-version alias from an immutable per-version release tag in `callisto tag`'s output). Both are backward-compatible — no existing command's behavior changes.
- Add Callisto-owned release PR decisions with forge snapshot verification
- **Fix: credential redaction now covers the live-streamed CI log, not just the captured error**
  
  `callisto publish` streams a registry command's stderr to the terminal in real time as it runs, separately from the captured copy redacted afterward for the final error message. A credential embedded in that stderr (e.g. a private registry URL with basic auth) was previously redacted only in the captured copy -- the live stream, which a CI log persists, was not. Both are now redacted identically; the captured copy stays raw internally so error classification (rate-limit, auth-failure detection) still works on the exact upstream text.
- **Add `callisto release-pr commit-plan`**
  
  A new read-only `callisto release-pr commit-plan --base-commit <sha> --message <msg> [--out <file>]` subcommand renders a `ReleasePrCommitPlanV1` as JSON from the current Git index diff against `<sha>`. It is the building block the release action now uses to stage a release-PR update through GitHub's `createCommitOnBranch` commit API instead of a local `git push`, so the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` never needs `.github/workflows/*` write permission on any ref. This removes the SHA-suffixed-replacement-branch churn the prior local-push fallback caused whenever a workflow file changed on the base branch.
- **Add `--skip-publish-precheck` to skip the redundant already-published registry check**
  
  `callisto publish` previously called the registry's `is_published` check before every publish attempt, even though a fresh publish always returns false there and a conflicting publish is already correctly classified as `AlreadyPublished` from the publish call itself. Pass `--skip-publish-precheck` to skip that extra round-trip; the default behavior is unchanged.

## 0.5.0

- # Native artifact placement for CI-built platform binaries
  
  - The shipped GitHub Action (`callisto-action`) now downloads each `callisto matrix`-driven native build's CI artifact and places it into its package directory automatically before `callisto publish` runs -- closing the gap between the build matrix and a working end-to-end release for napi-rs/maturin platform packages. No consumer-authored placement step is needed; it happens whenever `nativeMatrix` is non-empty and `publish` is enabled.
  - Fixed: two packages sharing the same target platform triple no longer collapse into one `artifactName`, which previously dropped one package's build from the release silently.
  - `callisto matrix --format json`'s `artifactName` values now follow napi-rs's own `<name>-<platform>-<arch>[-<abi>]` convention (previously the raw Rust target triple), and scoped npm package names such as `@scope/addon` no longer produce an `artifactName` containing `/`, which `actions/upload-artifact` rejects.

## 0.4.1

- Released together with the `workspace` fixed group.

## 0.4.0

- **New `callisto matrix` command**
  
  - Discovers napi and maturin platform targets from `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`.
  - Builds a per-triple CI table: host runner, cross-compile flag, artifact name.
  - Reports `engines.node`/`requires-python` versions.
- **Release-pipeline / CI Action contract correctness**
  
  - **Breaking:** several `--format json` field names changed or were added (`validate`, `compose-pr-body`, `tag`, `status`, `plan-publish`) — update any scripts parsing this output.
  - Re-tagging a release that already exists no longer reports the wrong commit sha.
  - The official GitHub Action now actually opens a release PR when changesets are pending — a bug made this step unreachable before.
  - GitHub Releases are now correctly marked prerelease for PEP 440 versions too (e.g. `1.2.3a1`), not just SemVer's `-` syntax.
  - Release notes now include the real changelog section instead of nothing.
- **Security hardening across publish, git, and subprocess handling**
  
  - **Breaking:** a package name starting with `-` is now reported as its own error, instead of being misreported as a path-traversal error.
  - A malicious package name can no longer inject extra flags into the underlying `cargo publish`/`npm publish`/`pypi publish` command.
  - A malicious `publishConfig.registry` URL can no longer redirect an npm publish to an unapproved registry.
  - An absolute or `..`-containing `changesets.dir`/changelog path in `callisto.toml` is now rejected instead of allowing writes outside the workspace.
  - Credentials no longer leak into error messages from failed git or registry-CLI commands.
  - A runaway subprocess can no longer exhaust memory via unbounded output capture, or hang a command indefinitely.
  - A tag name starting with `-` is now rejected, closing a git argument-injection hole.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- # Security hardening, correctness fixes, and performance improvements
  
  ## Security
  
  - **Argument injection in publish client** (`callisto-graph`): Package names are now validated before being passed to `cargo publish`, `npm publish`, and `pypi publish`. Names beginning with `-` are rejected with an error, preventing a crafted package name from injecting flags into the subprocess.
  - **Path traversal in `changesets.dir` config** (`callisto-graph`): The `changesets.dir` value from `callisto.toml` is now validated to contain no `..` components. A value like `../../tmp` previously allowed all changeset read and write operations to escape the workspace root.
  
  ## Correctness
  
  - **Changelog idempotency on stable release after pre-release** (`callisto-changelog`): The duplicate-entry guard in `prepend()` used a substring check that incorrectly matched `## 1.0.0-alpha.1` when writing `## 1.0.0`, permanently suppressing the stable release section. Now uses an exact line-boundary match.
  - **Empty changelog section headings** (`callisto-changelog`): `### Patch Changes` (and equivalent headings) are no longer emitted when every entry in the section has a blank summary.
  - **`pre-major-inference` config field now applied** (`callisto-graph`): The per-package `pre-major-inference` setting in `callisto.toml` was parsed and stored but never consulted. `aggregate()` hardcoded `OFF` for every package. The configured policy is now applied when constructing the inference window.
  - **Inference errors now surfaced as diagnostics** (`callisto-graph`): When `SeverityInference::infer` returns an error (e.g. due to a git failure), the error was previously swallowed with no diagnostic emitted and no bump recorded. The affected package now receives a warning-level diagnostic describing the failure.
  - **Ambiguous bare package name now errors in `status`** (`callisto-graph`): In a polyglot workspace containing both `cargo/foo` and `npm/foo`, a changeset entry naming bare `foo` was silently applied to every matching package. `status()` now returns `GraphError::AmbiguousName` with the full candidate list.
  - **Version overflow returns error instead of wrapping** (`callisto-format`): Incrementing a version component equal to `u64::MAX` previously wrapped to `0` in release builds (producing a version lower than the input) and panicked in debug builds. All bump paths now use `checked_add(1)` and return `BumpError::Overflow`.
  - **Decor preserved on full-table dependency form** (`callisto-manifests`): `CargoToml::update_dependency_spec` did not clone and reapply surrounding decor when the dependency used the `[dependencies.name]` full-table form, causing trailing comments and formatting to be lost on the first version bump.
  
  ## Performance
  
  - **O(N²) package lookups eliminated in publish and version commands** (`callisto-graph`): `plan_publish` and `plan_version` called `packages().find()` inside loops over package IDs and severity entries, giving O(N²) complexity. A single `HashMap<&PackageId, &Package>` is now built once before each loop.
  - **O(N) toposort validation** (`callisto-graph`): The toposort subset-validation loop called `all_packages.contains(id)` (O(N) slice scan) per member. A `HashSet` built once before the loop reduces this to O(N) total.
  - **Eliminated intermediate allocations in graph resolver** (`callisto-graph`): `dependencies_of()` and `dependents_of()` allocated a `Vec<&DepEdge>` and immediately called `into_iter()`. Both now return the iterator directly via `flat_map`.
  - **Unique changeset slugs without clock dependency** (`callisto-cli`): `generate_human_slug` derived all three word indices from a single nanosecond timestamp, yielding at most 8,000 distinct values. Concurrent `callisto add` calls on systems with coarse clock resolution could produce the same slug, causing `atomic_write` to silently overwrite the earlier changeset. Slugs now incorporate a process-global atomic counter for guaranteed uniqueness.
  
  ## Housekeeping
  
  - Removed unreachable `calculate_bump_severity` function from `cascade.rs` that was suppressed with `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
