# Active Work — Callisto

## Completed

### Track B: Idempotent `apply_version_plan` — DONE

Spec: `.claude/specs/track-b-idempotent-apply.json`
Implementation: `crates/callisto-graph/src/apply.rs`
Exit-gate: PASS. All 6 apply tests green, `just ci` exits 0.

### Track E: PackageId Specificity + Cross-Ecosystem Diagnostic — DONE

Spec: `.claude/specs/track-e-specificity.json`
Implementation: `crates/callisto-graph/src/walk.rs`, `crates/callisto-model/src/diagnostic.rs`, `crates/callisto-graph/src/aggregate.rs`
Exit-gate: PASS (2nd attempt). 620 tests, clippy clean, AC-1 through AC-11 verified.
Commits: T1 ce20787, T2 6cb3130, T3a f408845, T3b+T4 c0fdc96, post-gate fixes f8f168c

### Track F: resolve_package_config Extraction — DONE

Spec: `.claude/specs/track-f-resolution-extraction.json`
Implementation: `crates/callisto-graph/src/config/resolve.rs`, `src/walk.rs`, `src/aggregate.rs`
Exit-gate: PASS (high confidence, mutation-tested). 627 tests, clippy clean, AC-F1 through AC-F9 verified.

## Pipeline Protocol (follow for every track, in order)

1. `canon:canon-drafter` — write spec@1 to `.claude/specs/`
2. `canon:canon-auditor` — must pass before continuing
3. `canon:canon-exit-gate` — must pass before continuing
4. `vector:vector-planner` — produce plan@1 with exact red tests
5. `vector:vector-challenger` — must pass before continuing
6. `lambda:lambda-recon` — confirm baseline tests pass
7. `lambda:lambda-implementer` — one task at a time, red phase MANDATORY
8. `lambda:lambda-reviewer` — review each commit before next task
9. `lambda:lambda-exit-gate` — adversarial final check
10. `just ci` — must exit 0

Constraints:
- NEVER commit without explicit user instruction
- NEVER invoke `callisto publish` against any real registry
- Confirm test FAILS before writing implementation
- Do not interleave Track B and Track E implementation tasks
