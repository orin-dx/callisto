**Add `callisto filter-plan` and the primitives it's built on**

New `callisto filter-plan --plan <plan> --report <report>` filters a publish plan down to what a publish report confirms actually succeeded, dropping anything that failed. Lets a release pipeline run `plan-publish` -> `publish` -> `tag`/`gh release create` as separate steps and have the last two operate on what actually shipped, instead of the pre-publish plan.

Built on two new, additive primitives: `PublishPlan::is_empty()`, and `CreatedTag.isFloatingMajor` (distinguishes a floating major-version alias from an immutable per-version release tag in `callisto tag`'s output). Both are backward-compatible — no existing command's behavior changes.
